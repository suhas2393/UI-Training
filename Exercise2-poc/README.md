# POC - 1

Proof of concept to show how the event flows between different elements.

#### Layout : A div container which consists a FORM with a button inside it.

- Task 1: Button should be enabled only if the input ranges between 0-9.
- Task 2: Log the calling flow of the events.
- Task 2.1: Reverse the calling flow.
- Task 3: Only button should trigger the event.
- Task 4: Only button and form should be triggered.
- Task 5: Only button and container should be triggered.

#### I have implemented 4 functionalities to demonstrate this:

- Task 1,2,2.1 - bubbleAndCapture.js
- Task 3 - onlyButton.js
- Task 4 - buttonAndForm.js
- Task 5 - buttonAndContainer.js
